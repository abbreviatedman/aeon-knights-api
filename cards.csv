As you strike your final blow against Haze Fiend, a painful scream reverberates through the air. In a flash, the haze is gone and torches flicker back to life, lighting the camp. There is no sign of the fog, nor of the shadow you saw moving within: only the fallen remain.
Despite the horror, the survivors begin to move the bodies and seek out missing loved ones. As you survey the wreckage and help coordinate efforts, you feel a renewed sense of purpose. This time you were barely able to stop Haze Fiend before it devoured the whole camp. The Nameless must be destroyed at all costs. Read the back of L37.",,,,Legacy,L,36,,L36,10

The rumors were true: Maelstrom has awakened. Our scouts remain vigilant, watching over the sinkhole that appeared when Gravehold was destroyed, but it is only a matter of time before Maelstrom rises again.
Malastar has returned to the forge, working on new equpiment for you: tools to be used in the fight against Maelstrom. He has located a strange, powerful ore on the surface that can be used to further augment his craft.
This ore is guarded by a terrible Nameless, called Deathmind. After the initla squad returned with most of their memories wiped, our scouts kept their distance.

Battle 1 Introduction,Event,,,,,,,x,,"It has bean a week since Commander Soskel, one of New Gravehold's most decorated breach mages, led an expedition to the north. They were scheduled to return days ago, and the Council fears the worst. You are called upon to go after them. The loss of good mades is already painful enough, they explain, but Soskel and his party carried some of New Gravehold's rarest and most powerful artifacts. No matter what, you must find and return these treasures. You gather your gear and set out at once. The familiar trails of New Gravehold slowly give way to swampland. The air is mugg and thick in your lungs.
Read the back of this card.
You feel a strange sensation of being watched. You scan the dense underbrush and notice movement as someone turns and flees. Without hesitation, you chase them deeper into the swamp. Someone shouts, ""Release it!"" To your right, a gigantic insectoid Nameless crashes through the underbrush towards you. The man you're chasing ignores the creature and continues into the swamp. He'll have to wait. A Nameless this close to New Gravehold must be stopped.

Battle 1 Conclusion,Event,,,,,,,x,,"As the fight ends, you finally relax. The man and his allies have vanished, but during the battle you saw them watching and taking notes from a distance. You recognized the symbol on their cloaks. These are followers of Xaxos, the same ones who were exiled to these woods years ago. Could they and this strange pet Nameless have had somethingto do with the disappearance of Soskel's team? You tense up, seeing a burst of fire in the corner of your eye. You turn to see a woman with strange crystalline hair torching the corpse of one of MAggoth's minions until the ground around it is charred and blackened. ""Nameless scum."" She spits on the groun. ""If you let 'em sit, they fester and posion the soil. They're no good even when they're dead.""
Read the back of this card.
You recognize her as Rhia, a fellow breach mage, a master in the study of relics, and amember of the missing expedition! Rhia finishes disposing of the corpses and explains how her team was ambusehd by a strange, spiderlike Nameless. ""It was wrong,"" she says, bluntly, ""I've fought plenty of NAmeless but non of 'em coordinated their minions like this. Way too smart for those buggers. Buncha monsters shouldn't've been able to get the jump on us. We tried to retreat but Commander Soskel got captured and without a leader the orders got jumbled. We retreated in different directions."" She rubs her arm. ""I dunno who else is alive or where they are.""

Rhia leads you back towards where her expeditition was ambushed to begin looking for survivors. The swamp gives way to trees as you trek farther north. You keep an eye out for the Xaxos followers from earlier, but the woods seem empty.

The thick branches creak in the wind, and even the midday sun struggles to pierce their oppressive shade. The thick crackling energy in the air makes your hair stand on end. Something dangerous is near. You crest a hill and spot a massive swirling breach with a twisted shape kneeling before it. Inside the portal, you barely make out the shape of a gigantic shadowy spider. You inch closer, unable to ocmprehend what you're watching. The kneeling creature seems humanoid, except for a mass of arachnid legs bursting from its spine. Breach energy flows into its skin as it communes with the portal. ""That's the Nameless we fought,"" Rhia whispers beside you.

Battle 2 Introduction,Event,,,,,,,x,,"""I am no mere Nameless. They bow to me now."" Rhia goes rigid with shock. It can speak? The spider creature twists around towards you. His face is warped, but undeniably human. ""Why have you returned? I dont have to have to kill you. Let me finish my experiment in peace."" The creature stands, his segmented legs snapping into place one by one. The portal behind him wavers, opening briefly to reveal a man within, bound and gagged by spiderwebs. Commander Soskel. He struggles against the void energy seeping from the breach into his skin.
""Let him go!"" Rhia barks, taking a step forward. The creature slams his foot down, blocking her path.

""You fooling mages. You scorn Xaxos for daring to evolve. We can use the power of the Nameless to become stronger. I can save Gravehold!"" He spreads his arms. ""Then the people will worship their true saviors, my master Xaxos and his faithful studen, the great Arachnos!""

Battle 2 Conclusion,Event,,,,,,,x,,"As silence falls over the battlefield, you inspect your adversary, Arachnos. His ambition to become more powerful than the Nameless made him the enemy of the very people he was trying to protect, just like Xaxos. It pains you to see promising mages lost to the temptation of breach magic.
Rhia rushes towards the still-swirling breach and grabs Soskel, pulling him free. AFter concentrating briefly you force the portal closed behind him. Rhia gently frees him from his restraints as his limp body sinks to the groun. He looks drained, but alive.
Read the back of this card.
Soskel's chest rises and falls with shaky breath. Tears brim in his eyes as he rubs at his wrists. ""Brama was wrong. I'm a failure as al eader. Arachnos captured me and I could do nothing but watch my friends fall one by one.""
As he calms down, you notice that you can't see his pupils. When you mention it, Soskel touches his face gently. ""It must be the void energy starting to warp me. Thihs kind of power is more than any human should bear. Even the amount inside of me..."" Soskel grips his arms and shuggers. ""It's almost too much.""

Battle 2 Conclusion (cont.),Event,,,,,,,x,,"Soskel tries to ather himself as he lead you to his companions who fell in battle. He leans heavily against Rhia with tears streaming down his face as they prepare the ritual for the fallen of Gravehold. ""If Dezmodia were still here, she could've stopped all this. She would've stopped him long ago, "" he curses. Nearby, you see what must have been one of Arachnos' experiments. A strange object is outlined with glowing runes. You immediately recoil from the Nameless energy you can feel radiating out of it.

""We should take it."" Soskel walks pas you and grabs the artifact, undeterred by its dark aura. His strength returned faster than you thought was possible. ""When I was captured I saw Talix escaping further north. If he's still alive we need to find him. This Nameless energy is in me... it's powerful. And I'm not going to ignore power when one of my team is in danger."" He pauses, growing more serious. ""I promised his son I'd bring him home.""

Battle 3 Introduction,Event,,,,,,,x,,"You trek through the woods for hours before Rhia spots something off. An old man, collapsed by a tree a few yards ahead, surrounded by piles of yellowing bones. The man looks haggard, his skin gray and drooping. If he hadn't been clutching his distinctive chain, you might not have recognized Talix, but the Talix you know is a young man in his prime. Soskel rushes over and kneels besides Talix, laying a hand on the side of his face.
""Commander."" Talix's voice is a pained wheeze. ""Be careful. It's still nearby."" He points a withered finger towards the skeletons. You recognize the symbol of Xaxos on their cloaks, the same cloaks the men who set Maggoth on you wore.
Read the back of this card.
Talix is overcome by coughing. You look up to see leaves age and disintegrate before your eyes. As their branches grow thin and gray, you stand and turn to see a skeletal creature, almost human-shaped, dripping with void essence. Where it steps, the grass withers and dies. You move in front of Talix, ready to defend him.

Battle 3 Conclusion,Event,,,,,,,x,,"After you finish your battle with the source of the surrounding blight, Rhia steps forward, ready to incinerate the remains, but you hold her back long enough to examine what is left of the creature. Its skeletal body looks older than the world itself, the face sunken beyond recognition. On its cloak is the symbol of Xaxos. Just like Arachnos, this man was a mage once, but now he is more Nameless than human. The thought chills you. You had no idea that there were so many followers of Xaxos still out here, or just how dangerous they had become. You are pulled from your reverie by Talix sauntering up to you, restored from his untimely aging. Read the back of this card.
""I thought I was done for when I ran into a bunch of Xaxos's cronies, but this thing showed up and killed everyone, even its own brothers. Well, it would have been everyone if you hadn't saved me."" Talix nudges the creature's body with his foot. ""That thing walked like a human, dressed like one of theirs, but there was humanity behind those eyes.""
Commander Soskel grows serious. ""Perhaps that was what Arachnos wanted me to become."" Silence falls across your group as you all pause to consider what might have happened if no one had come to his rescue.

""I never thought I'd see you again, Sos--I mean, Commander."" With his chin still on Soskel's shoulder, Talix tosses an irreverant salute. Soskel shakes his head and pushes Talix off of him.

You shiver as a snowflake lands on your cheek. Snow? In this climate? Suddenly, the wind picks up and the gentle snow turns into a raging blizzard. Squinting against the storm you see six glowing eyes. Your blood turns to ice as the Nameless lets out a mind-shattering howl.

""Commander, I've found something off."" Rhia presses her ear to the ground and knocks on it three times. The noise reverberates strangely, as if she's hitting something hollow. ""I hear banging in here."" Rhia feels along the ground and pulls open a hidden trap door, revealing an underground bunker. You leap to your feet, ready for yet another battle. Read the back of this card.
Inside is a massive metal figure with tongues of flame spilling from its joints. The armor lifts a hefty blacksmith's hammer and brings it down on the glowing edge of a blade. A squirrel-like creature is curled up on its shoulder, unafraid. The armor seems friendly enough, so you cautiously introduce yourself and it rumbles back, ""I am Lost."" It points to the squirrel. ""Meek."" All around the little room are weapons and equipment radiating with power. This... being must understand breach magic. You try to question Lost futher but you're met with sad confusion. Each word seems like a struggle. ""My mind is damage. I was a man but now... I do not know what I am. Who I am. I am from far away, from my coffin home.""

Lost nods again and Soskel steps forward, laying a comfortaing hand on Lot's arm. ""You're not staying here another second, Lost. We're taking you home."" It's impossible to tell from the armor, but you think Lost is smiling. You help gather the artifacts and weapons scattered around this odd forgemaster's abode. Lost grabs his hammer and scratches Meek affectionately on the head. You lead Lost out of the bunker and turn towards home, finally ready to head back to New Gravehold. He doesn't look back once. Read the back of this card.
You report to the Council of Elders upon your return to New Gravehold. They listen intently as you recount the fakte of Soskel's allies, the rise and fall of Arachnos' plot for power, and the discovery of the strange mage Lost. The elders thank you for bringing back the treasures Soskel's team had left with, the powerful new weapons from Lost's collection, and for rescuing some of the missing mages. It seems, for once, that humanity has the upper hand. Suddenly, you hear a bang from the entrance to the hall as the doors are slammed open. You sigh. The work of a breach mage is never done.

""While the sunslept, I told Razra of the infection that threatens us. Now she and Rip have vanished."" As he gestures, you notice the plants around him sway and grow. Inco is the only mage you know who can control plants in this way.
Read the back of this card.
""We've been practicing breach magic together since I arrived here. She is stubborn, very very stubborn. Help me find her."" Inco thrusts a note in your face.
""Dear Inco, catch up if you can. Rip and I will fix the crops before you even arrive.""
Now, not only do you need to find whatever is killing the plants, but you must also rein in the headstrong young breach mage Razra. ""The plants will guide me to her."" Inco says as he rushes out of Gravehold, leaving you to catch up.

Battle 1 Introduction,Event,,,,,,,x,,"You've never seen Inco bring such... growth. You watch in fascination as the surrounding plants sprout to life behind him. After New Gravehold has been out of sight for some time, you realize just how dire the situation is. The council was wrong to wait. Inco's path stands in stark contrast to the death all around you. His eyes soften with relief each time he rejuvenates a nearby dying tree. He revives what he can, but it is only a fraction of all the endagered plants. You swat a swarms of buzzing insects drawn by the decaying plants while following Inco deeper into the dying vegetation.
Read the back of this card.
""We will find Razra on this path."" As he says her name, a mass of colorful flowers bloom around Inco's feet, oddly hopeful against your bleak surroundings. Suddenly, you stop, engulfed in silence. When did it get so quiet? The droning insects are gone. A heavy thudding shakes the ground. Whatever it is, it's big and has friends. Your team opens breaches and prepares for battle.

Battle 1 Conclusion,Event,,,,,,,x,,"With your hard fought battle over, you rest uneasily knowing that Razra is still out there somewhere, potentially fighting Nameless just like this one with only Rip at her side. While resting, you notice several strange glyphs in the area. Reflecting on the fight, you realize these glyphs seemed to trap the Nameless. It was clearly drawn to them against its will. Making and maintaining Nameless-attracting glyphs cannot be an easy task, they must require a massive amount of aether to maintain.
Read the back of this card.
These glyphs complicate your mission even more. You need to find Razra, share information, and come up with a plan. ""Come. Move your roots."" Inco says as he hurries back to the path. Finding the glyphs has unnerved him. As you follow, a plant's branch tunnels directly into the dirt below his feet. You jump over a root that's suddenly grown in front of you. A tree collapses as it branches grow massive while its trunk remains the same. You hang back a safe distance as Into leaves more and more chaos in his wake.

Battle 1 Conclusion (cont.),Event,,,,,,,x,,"Intent on the mission, Inco is oblivious to the massive lopsided growth he has subconciously created. Suddenly, he motions you to stop and be silent. Just ahead, you see a gouge in the earth filled with ash, its edged charred. As you peer through the tall brush, you see several cloaked figures laying on the ground. No one is moving. After waiting several minutes, tense and ready for another fight, Inco parts the brush with his hand and walks into the clearing. The bodies strewn about are followers of Xaxos. The scarred landscape indicates a recent battle. As you searc the area, you spot valuable artifacts imbued with a strange energy. Read the back of this card.
On closer inspection, you realize the artifacts belong to mages of New Gravehold. As you're collecting them, Razra's animal companion, Rip, stumbles into the clearing, bleeding and whimpering. Inco rushes to embrace his lost friend. The large, sleep, metallic creature nuzzles Inco. After their quick reunion, Rip dashes away and then stops and turns, waiting for you to follow.

Something in this grove holds fearsome power. What if Razra was overcome in this stifling place?Walking along, you catch a climpse of a carving in the trunk of a tree through the willows.

Deep in thought, you barely notice the wind pick up and a thrumming begin.

Read the back of this card.
The glyphs near the battle stop glowing as you walk away. The farther you walk, the more anxious and exceited Rip becomes. Finally, Rip leads you to a clearing where you discover Razra. The now familiar glyphs are scattered around her, once more glowing brilliantly. She's held in some kind of organic prison, completely immobilized by a criss-crossing network of vines. Tendrils of breach energy spill from Razra's mouth directly into an object perched atop a pedestal. Distressed, Rip lets out a low rumbling.

The glyphs engraved on the stone pedestal are bright than any of the others you've seen. Frustrated by the strength of the prison, Inco takes a step back, breathes deeply, and calls a mass of thorns from below his feet that quickly eviscerate the magical plant shackles.

Inco catches Razra as she stumbles free. They embrace, trembling. ""What took you so long?"" Her hands betray her bravado. ""Ugh. Now I know how breaches feel. I have been literally sucked dry.""

Xaxos' insignia is scratched into the ground at her feet. She signals Rip to dig. For a moment, Razra is showered by first from an overly enthusiastic RIp, before she gives him a playful reprimand.

You hear it carving through the trees behind you, destroying everything in its path. While you were busy fighting Necroswarm, this mage must have been maintaining the glyphs. ""Blast it all. She's too strong and too far away now."" Razra grinds her teeth and lets out a wordless scream. It's time for a new plan. You decide to return to New Gravehold immediately. The council must know of the traitor in your ranks.

Battle 4 Conclusion (cont.),Event,,,,,,,x,,"Inco lags behind, kicking the ground occasionally. His gaze wanders, searching for an answer. You move to comfort him, but Razra gently touches your shoulder. ""He was raised by that creature. It lives in peace, far away from any humans. He left to find people like him. No one else knows except Talix.""
Inco sighs, ""My old family just wanted to survive. That traitor must have found a way to control them. They must have made my family attack us. If it got much closer, it could've destroyed all of our crops, all of our food. We would've been helpless."" The trek home is spent in silence as attempts to start conversation are met with apatehtic mumbling. Upon returning to New Gravehold, you report to the council.
Read the back of this card.
""I can save the crops, but there's a bigger problem."" Inco says, ""A veteran mage of Gravehold betrayed us."" He scans the council's eyes. Seeing no surprise, he tightens his hands into fists. ""My home is carrion. You could've stopped this!""
Brama treads carefully, ""If the people knew about this traitor, your new home, our home, would be in chaos. We would fall to the next Nameless attack."" You fear that this new foe may be more dangerous than any Nameless you're ever fought before.
