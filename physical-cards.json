You turn back towards New Gravehold, but only make it a few steps out of the clearing before you stumble on a divot in the ground. Pushing away the dead leaves, you see a gigantic paw print, as wide across as your arm.\r\nRead the back of this card.\r\nYou shiver as a snowflake lands on your cheek. Snow? In this climate? Suddenly, the wind picks up and the gentle snow turns into a raging blizzard. Squinting against the storm you see six glowing eyes. Your blood turns to ice as the Nameless lets out a mind-shattering howl.\r\nOpen envelope 4. Open deck 4. Use the cards in this deck to set up the nemesis deck. There are four upgraded basic cards in this deck that you will use when setting up every nemesis for the rest of the expedition.\r\nFight Fenrix. At the end of your game versus Fenrix, if you won read the front of NA-Ex-12. If you lost, fight it again. After your second game, read the front of NA-Ex-12.",

Commander Soskel calls for a rest and you sink gratefully to the forest floor, leaning back against a tree.\r\n\"Commander, I've found something off.\" Rhia presses her ear to the ground and knocks on it three times. The noise reverberates strangely, as if she's hitting something hollow. \"I hear banging in here.\" Rhia feels along the ground and pulls open a hidden trap door, revealing an underground bunker. You leap to your feet, ready for yet another battle. Read the back of this card.\r\nInside is a massive metal figure with tongues of flame spilling from its joints. The armor lifts a hefty blacksmith's hammer and brings it down on the glowing edge of a blade. A squirrel-like creature is curled up on its shoulder, unafraid. The armor seems friendly enough, so you cautiously introduce yourself and it rumbles back, \"I am Lost.\" It points to the squirrel. \"Meek.\" All around the little room are weapons and equipment radiating with power. This... being must understand breach magic. You try to question Lost futher but you're met with sad confusion. Each word seems like a struggle. \"My mind is damage. I was a man but now... I do not know what I am. Who I am. I am from far away, from my coffin home.\"\r\nRead the front of NA-Ex-13.",

We're taking you home.\" It's impossible to tell from the armor, but you think Lost is smiling. You help gather the artifacts and weapons scattered around this odd forgemaster's abode. Lost grabs his hammer and scratches Meek affectionately on the head. You lead Lost out of the bunker and turn towards home, finally ready to head back to New Gravehold. He doesn't look back once. Read the back of this card.\r\nYou report to the Council of Elders upon your return to New Gravehold. They listen intently as you recount the fakte of Soskel's allies, the rise and fall of Arachnos' plot for power, and the discovery of the strange mage Lost. The elders thank you for bringing back the treasures Soskel's team had left with, the powerful new weapons from Lost's collection, and for rescuing some of the missing mages. It seems, for once, that humanity has the upper hand. Suddenly, you hear a bang from the entrance to the hall as the doors are slammed open. You sigh. The work of a breach mage is never done.\r\nRead the front of NA-Ex-14.",
